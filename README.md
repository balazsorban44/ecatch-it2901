## Project description
Reporting of catch done by fishing vessels is a vital part of protecting life in the
ocean. In Norway this reporting is done to the Directorate of Fisheries, which
controls fishing quotas and everything else related to fishing. Today, there are
mainly larger vessels reporting capture digitally, but smaller vessels might also
have to report in the future.
This provides a new and challenging user group, where one has vessels with few
people on board who will do a lot, and reporting of catch comes in addition to
everyday life.

The goal of this project is to create a Progressive Web App for reporting of catch
by small fishing vessels. The project will focus mostly on the front end, but it will
also create a simple REST API that can receive data. It is desirable that the front
end will be developed in React. You are free to choose technology for the backend.

The app should be designed for mobile and tablet and must facilitate use on fishing
vessels. It is relevant to do exploratory work as interview with potential users to
create a service that integrates into their daily lives without disturbing the work
they do. ... An exciting task that will make everyday living
better for many Norwegians while supporting the important work of the
Directorate of Fisheries. ...
